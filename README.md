# reWASD (7.1.0.8668)
- reWASD Crack for x86/x64 ONLY (BETA CRACK V2)!
- ARM Crack linked here: [ARM Crack Repo](https://github.com/EugeneSunrise/reWASD)

## NOTICE

The crack for 7.1.0.8668 is still in progress and only covers the license, trial popup and anti-kill.
The Features are not cracked yet, out method used for 7.0 doesn't quite work for 7.1 and requires a bit more fine-tuning.
So until then, this crack will stay in BETA. Thanks <3

**This started as a personal MITM project to figure out how the licensing was being checked and modify the packets on the go, until I got sick of writing addons then started looking for a permanent way to activate the license and it's features**
